Why Go language?
=>Python-Easy to use but slow
  Java-Increasingly complex type system
  C/C++-Complex type system,slow compile time
 Also at the time these languages were created,single threaded processes were mostly used,so a bit inefficient with multi-threaded processes.
 
Go-golang
->Strong and statically typed language-inherits this feature from Java and C++
  Strong typing means that the type of the variable cannot change over time-if I declare an integer a then we can only keep an integer in it-not a boolean or string
  Statically typing means all of the variables have to be defined at the compile time
->Excellent Community

Key Features:-
1)Simplicity
2)Fast Compile time
3)Garbage Collected language-you do not need to manage your own memory-you can manage your memory but the GO runtime is going to manage the memory.
  The reason for that gets back to the simplicity arguement.There is a recognition that a garbage collected language does have challenges while dealing with certain 
  usecases for eg.-Real time trading system for stock market systems have a very tough time while dealing with garbage collection.However the advantage is on the developer
  side is to not manage the memory all the time-that doesnt mean that the delays that the garbage collector incurs havent been paid attention to.If we go back to the history 
  of garbage collection then go language has improved upon the time of pause for garbage collection
4)Built in Concurrency-We do not need to import any library to do this,we can do this in the base language
5)Go compiles down to a standalone binaries which means that when you compile your Go application everything is going to be bundled under that single binary that is related
  to that application itself,so the go runtime,any library is bundled in a single binary

  package fmt-used to format strings
  
  //CODE-
  
  package main
  
  import {
          "fmt"
  }
  
  func main(){
         fmt.Println("Hello,playground")
  }
  
  //VARIABLES
  ->Variable declaration
  ->Redeclaration and shadowing
  ->Visibility-we can control what aspects of our program can see a variable that we create
  ->Naming conventions
  ->Type Conversions
  
  //Code
  
  package main
  
  import {
           "fmt"
           
  }
  
  //At the package level we cannot use the colun syntax
  
  //declaration at the package level
  
  var t int=42
  
  //We can create a block of variables that are declared together-At the package level
  
  var actorName string ="gbfbf bvrfberkl"
  var companion string="vv efeef efqggrn"
  var doctorNumber int=3
  var season int=l1
  
  //This is a block of variables-we can declare them as follows-
  
  var(
       
   actorName string ="gbfbf bvrfberkl"
   companion string="vv efeef efqggrn"
   doctorNumber int=3
   season int=l1
  
  )
  
  var(
    counter int=0
  )
  
  func main(){
             var i int
             i=42
             i=27
             fmt.Println(i)
             var z int=34
             fmt.Println(z)
             y:=65
             fmt.Println(y)
             k:=99.
             fmt.Printf("%v,%T",k,k)
             fmt.Printf("%v,%T",t,t)
  }
  
  //Re-assignment of variable wont create an error but re declaration of the variable will create an error
  The variable present at the innermost level in the function overshadows the outer variables-This is called shadowing
  
  If a varable is declared but not used then the program will show error.
  
  package main
  
  import {
       "fmt"
  }
  
  func main(){
         var i int=42
         j:=13
         
         fmt.Println(i)
         
  }
  
  
  //Naming the variable:-
    
   If the variable is declared at the package level in lowercase then it is accessible to that package only but if it is declared in uppercase then it is accessible 
   to the outside world as well.
   
   package main
   
   import{
       "fmt"
   }
   
   var I int =42
   func main(){
          var i int =43
          j:=13
          
          fmt.Println(i)
   }
   
   3 levels of visibility of the variables in GO:-
   1)If variable is at the package level and declared in small then it is accessible to that package only.Any file in that package can access that variable.
   2)If variable is upper case at the package level then it is exported from the package and globally visible.
   3)If the variable is declared inside a main function then it is accessible in that main block only.
   
   If you declare a variable that is going to be used for a very long time then its length should also be large and vice-versa.
   
   If we are dealing with any acronym while naming a variable then it should all be in uppercase.eg:-
   
   
   package main
   
   import{
       "fmt"
   }
   
   var I int =42
   func main(){
          var i int =43
          j:=13
          var theHTTP string="https://google.com"
          fmt.Println(i)
   }
   
   //How to convert from one variable type to another
   
   
   package main
   
   import{
       "fmt"
   }
   
   func main(){
          var i int =43
          fmt.Printf("%v,%T\n",i,i)
          
          var j float32
          j=float32(i)
          fmt.Printf("%v, %T\n",j,j)
   }
  
  Note:-If I am converting a float to int then the values after the decimal point will get lost.Only the integer part of it will be retained.
  
  //Converting number to string
  
  package main
  
  import (
        "fmt"
  )
  
  func main(){
       var i int=42
       fmt.Printf("%v,%T\n",i,i)
       
       var j string
       j=string(i)
       fmt.Printf("%v,%T\n",j,j)
  }
  
  //This will o/p the astrix as per the serial number of characters
  
  
  package main
  
  import (
        "fmt"
        "strconv"
  )
  
  func main(){
       var i int=42
       fmt.Printf("%v,%T\n",i,i)
       
       var j string
       j=strconv.Itoa(i)
       fmt.Printf("%v,%T\n",j,j)
  }
